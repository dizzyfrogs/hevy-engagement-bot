## Features 

**Follow Management**
- Automatically identifies and follows users who actively engage with workouts (commenting or liking)
- Ensures that targeted users have recent activity on the platform before a follow request is sent, avoiding inactive accounts
- Locally caches users previously followed by the bot to prevent redundant follow requests

**Unfollow Management**
- Automatically unfollows users who have been inactive for a configurable duration
- Identifies and unfollows users who do not follow back within a configurable period
- Allows for whitelisting of users who the bot should never unfollow
- Only users originally followed by the bot are considered for unfollowing, so that manual connections are preserved

**Post Liking**
- Acts as a workaround for the daily follow limit, as there is no known limit for liking posts.
- Discovers new workouts through the Hevy feed and automatically likes them to increase visibility.

**Notifications**
- Integrates with Discord webhooks to send notifications and summaries of bot activities (users followed, unfollowed, etc.)

**Scheduling**
- Can be configured to run all processes automatically at predefined intervals using a cron-based scheduler

## How It Works
The Hevy Engagement Bot operates by interacting with the Hevy API to simulate user activity. Here's a general overview of its process:

  1. **Authentication**: The bot authenticates with the Hevy API using your provided auth token
  2. **Configuration**: It loads settings from `config/config.yaml`, which sets daily limits, delays, and scheduling.
  3. **Discovery Feed Analysis**:
  - The bot fetches the "Discovery Feed," which contains recent workouts, comments, and likes from other Hevy users.
  - It parses this data to identify potential users to follow or workouts to like based on their activity.
  - Before following, it quickly checks the target's recent workout activity to make sure they're not inactive.
  4. **Follow/Like Execution**: The bot sends follow/like requests through the API.
  5. **Following Cache Update**: When a user is followed, their details and the timestamp of the follow are added to a local cache. This helps determine unfollow criteria and avoid duplicate follows.
  6. **Unfollow Logic**:
  - The bot reviews the users in its followed cache.
  - It checks each cached user's last workout date to determine inactivity.
  - It also checks if the user has followed back within the defined threshold.
  - Users meeting the unfollow criteria (and are not on the whitelist) are unfollowed.
  - A separate unfollowed cache tracks users that have been unfollowed to prevent refollowing them.
  7. **Notifications**: Throughout the operation, the bot sends notifications to a Discord webhook.

## Proven Results

This bot has been rigorously tested on a dedicated Hevy account. Over a period of just one month, the account's follower count increased from **31 to over 1,000 followers**, demonstrating the effectiveness of taking advantage of engagement techniques.

## Setup

To get the Hevy Engagement Bot up and running, follow these steps:
1. **Environment Variables (`.env` file)**:
  Create a file names `.env` in the root directory.
  ```
  # API Credentials
  AUTH_TOKEN=
  # Discord Webhook (Optional)
  DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=
  ```
2. **Configuration File (`config/config.yaml` - Optional)**:
  Customize the bot's configuration by editing the `config/config.yaml` file.
  ```yaml
    # Scheduler Settings
    scheduler:
      follow_schedule: "0 12 * * *"    # Run at 12 PM daily
      unfollow_schedule: "0 12 * * *"  # Run at 12 PM daily
      like_schedule: "0 * * * *"       # Run every hour at minute 0

    # API Settings
    api:
      base_url: "https://api.hevyapp.com"
      rate_limit_delay: 300  # 5 minutes
      request_delay:
        min: 1.5
        max: 3.0

    # Follow Settings
    follow:
      target_count: 30     # Daily follow limit
      comment_priority: 2  # Higher priority for users who comment
      like_priority: 1     # Lower priority for users who only like

    # Unfollow Settings
    unfollow:
      inactive_threshold: 21    # days
      follow_back_threshold: 7  # days
      daily_unfollow_cap: 100

    # Like Settings
    like:
      like_cap: 50         # Max number of workouts to like per run
  ```
3. **Whitelist (`data/whitelist.json` - Optional)**:
  If there are specific users you wish to permanently exclude from the unfollow process, add their usernames to `data/whitelist.json`. Example:
  
```JSON
[
  "username1",
  "username2",
  "username3"
]
```
